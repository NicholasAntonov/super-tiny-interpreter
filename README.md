# THE SUPER TINY INTERPREER

Welcome to The Super Tiny Interpreter. It's an ultra simplified example of all the
major pieces of a modern interpreter written in easy to read JavaScript. Reading
through it can help you learn about how most interpreter work end to end.

### Why should I care?

That's fair, most people don't really have to think about interpreters in their day
jobs. However, interpreters are all around you, tons of the tools you use are based
on concepts borrowed from interpreters.

### But interpreters are scary!

Yes, they are. But that's our fault (the people who write interpreters), we've
taken something that is reasonably straightforward and made it so scary that
most think of it as this totally unapproachable thing that only the nerdiest of
the nerds are able to understand.

### Okay so where do I begin?

Awesome! Head on over to the [super-tiny-interpreter.js](super-tiny-interpreter.js)
file.

### I'm back, that didn't make sense

Ouch, I'm really sorry. I'm planning on doing a lot more work on this to add
inline annotations. If you want to come back when that's done, you can
watch/star this repo  for updates.

### Tests

Run with `node test.js`
